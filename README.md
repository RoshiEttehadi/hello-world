Allow users to easily compare and contrast different options for the same item. For example, if you are looking for a new fridge, you are going to different stores and websites. This website allows a user to save information for each fridge they are considering purchasing, including things like its price, brand, location/store and a photo of the item. The end goal is to make it easy for the user to compare the items they are choosing from.
